# GoogleFormVis
A visualisation tool of google forms results

This is a tool to create (currently) edge bundling visualisation of multichoice questions in Google Form surveys.
It helps breaking down the standard statistics given by Google Drive.

[Here](http://edosil.net/presentations/CCPPETMR/result.html) an example.

The code has taken initial inspiration from the [Hierarchical Edge Bundling](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1044242) example from Mike Bostok, and the [line chart with dropdown selector](http://bl.ocks.org/jhubley/17aa30fd98eb0cc7072f) from [Jill Hubley](http://jillhubley.com/)
